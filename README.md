###  Jasmin Transpiler 
A modular transpiler that converts a C-like language into functional Jasmin bytecode, enabling cross-platform flexibility and scalability for multiple architectures. Leveraged intermediate representations to decouple phases, allowing for future extension to other target architectures or higher-level optimizations.

### Getting Started
Make sure that your CLASSPATH includes the parent directory that contains the directory VC. Note that VC does not appear in the CLASSPATH. 

Create and run your scanner on a UNIX-based machine as follows:
Compile the Java files with `javac vc.java`
